# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements comprehensive code splitting and lazy loading optimization for a React TypeScript application to improve initial load performance, reduce bundle sizes, and enhance user experience through intelligent chunk loading strategies. The implementation includes lazy loading of page components, performance monitoring, preloading utilities, and optimized build configuration.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to load quickly on initial visit, so that I can start using the application without waiting for unnecessary code to download.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL split code into separate chunks for each page component
2. WHEN a user visits the homepage THEN the system SHALL only load the code necessary for the homepage
3. WHEN the initial bundle loads THEN the system SHALL achieve a reduction of at least 50% in initial JavaScript bundle size
4. WHEN chunks are created THEN each page chunk SHALL be optimized to be under 5KB when possible

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want pages to load smoothly when navigating, so that I have a seamless browsing experience without jarring loading states.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN navigating to a new page THEN the system SHALL display a loading spinner while the page component loads
2. WHEN a lazy component fails to load THEN the system SHALL display an error boundary with retry functionality
3. WHEN loading states are shown THEN the system SHALL provide bilingual support (Arabic/English) for loading messages
4. WHEN loading components are displayed THEN the system SHALL meet accessibility standards with proper ARIA labels

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to intelligently preload likely-needed components, so that subsequent navigation feels instant.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user hovers over navigation links THEN the system SHALL preload the associated page component
2. WHEN the user is idle for more than 2 seconds THEN the system SHALL preload high-priority components
3. WHEN preloading occurs THEN the system SHALL respect user's network conditions and avoid preloading on slow connections
4. WHEN components are preloaded THEN the system SHALL cache them for immediate use

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to monitor the performance impact of code splitting, so that I can optimize the implementation and track improvements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN components load THEN the system SHALL track and log loading times for each chunk
2. WHEN the application runs in development mode THEN the system SHALL provide detailed performance metrics
3. WHEN chunks are loaded THEN the system SHALL measure and report bundle sizes
4. WHEN performance data is collected THEN the system SHALL provide methods to export metrics for analysis

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the build system to automatically optimize chunk splitting, so that the application maintains optimal performance without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application builds THEN the system SHALL automatically split vendor libraries into separate chunks
2. WHEN common code is identified THEN the system SHALL create shared chunks to avoid duplication
3. WHEN the build completes THEN the system SHALL generate a chunk analysis report
4. WHEN chunks are created THEN the system SHALL ensure proper cache invalidation through content hashing

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user with a slow internet connection, I want the application to handle loading failures gracefully, so that I can still use the application even when some components fail to load.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a chunk fails to load THEN the system SHALL retry loading up to 3 times with exponential backoff
2. WHEN all retry attempts fail THEN the system SHALL display a user-friendly error message with manual retry option
3. WHEN network errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide offline-friendly fallback content where possible
4. WHEN errors are handled THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information for debugging
