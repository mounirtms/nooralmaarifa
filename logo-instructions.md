# Logo Creation Instructions

Since you want to use the upper part of your existing `image.jpeg` as the logo and favicon, here are the steps:

## Method 1: Using Online Tools (Recommended)
1. Open https://www.remove.bg/ or https://www.canva.com/
2. Upload your `image.jpeg` file
3. Crop to focus on the upper portion that contains the nice design
4. Save as PNG format for transparency
5. Resize to:
   - Logo: 220px × 65px (for header)
   - Favicon: 32px × 32px (square format)

## Method 2: Using Basic Image Editor
1. Open `image.jpeg` in any image editor (Paint, GIMP, Photoshop, etc.)
2. Select the upper portion that has the nice design
3. Crop to keep only that section
4. Resize to the dimensions mentioned above
5. Save as PNG

## File Names:
- Save the logo as `logo.png` (replace the current logo.svg)
- Save the favicon as `favicon.ico` or `favicon.png`

## After Creating the Files:
1. Replace `logo.svg` with your new `logo.png`
2. Add the favicon to the HTML head section
3. Update the logo reference in HTML to use the new file
